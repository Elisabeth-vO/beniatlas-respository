# beniatlas-repository

BeniAtlas is a project to create a digital mapping framework for the city of Beni in the Democratic Republic
of Congo. The goal is to design a phased program that meets the needs of the community and the university that is 
implimenting the project, but also to imagine how the framework can be extended by adding different types of 
interactivity (Aggregating data from different sources, collecting and reporting from the public, social networking,
and game/simulation). For the purpose of sharing on GitHub and resolving the code, the data is ficticious.
